<q>Also we need to have a very serious talk about the condition of the apartment and the property.  The outside is getting beyond ok with stuff on the lawn and every where.  And the shower, which was brand new, is now coated in dirt and grime, not mold.  You guys need to clean that place up and keep it clean </q></div> <div class="message"><abbr class="dt" title="2014-09-24T15:02:22.202Z">Sep 24, 2014, 3:02:22 PM
