<q>First off that&#39;s a relatively small problem compared to all the numerous problems with capitalism. Anarchism isn&#39;t against punishment at all, it&#39;s against punishment by those in power. Also, when peoples needs are being met as they most likely would be in a an anarcho-syndicalist world, people would be much less inclined to steal. And all of this would be post revolution so it would also be unlikely that federations would rise up and ta</q></div> <div class="message"><abbr class="dt" title="2011-09-15T15:07:12.342Z">Sep 15, 2011, 3:07:12 PM

<q>and I also think it would be impossible for tribes to be uncooperative and not have good community with other tribes, providing that anarcho-syndicalist people would want products that would be impossible to make locally.
