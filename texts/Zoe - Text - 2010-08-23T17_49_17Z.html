<q>alright so as you sleep the electrical impulses that fire neurons in your brain change from upwards of 10hz to below 10hz, or something like that.

<q>Trippy: im in this really strange white house with wood floors, im looking at things as if im a really tall person. Theres a small old asian woman running around and saying things to me but with everything she says she becomes more birdlike. Soon she has arm like wings on her back and in the end she turns into this black raven and flies away.</q></div> <div class="message"><abbr class="dt" title="2010-08-24T03:30:39.010Z">Aug 24, 2010, 3:30:39 AM
