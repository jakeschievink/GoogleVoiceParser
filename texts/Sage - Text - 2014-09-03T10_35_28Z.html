<q>I just had this dream. We were both on a trip but u left early because you were just dying to marry this girl. The wedding was this: there were two cages, you were in one and she and this other boy who I think also wanted to marry her were in the other. You both ran out terrifyingly angry. You had to use weapons that u had to hit against a very hard door made out of planks of bronze. You were using a battle axe that was black with silver studs all over it, also on the handle. They pronounced that he had won, and u were gonna try again the next day. Then I was standing over the food with you guys and I was like: &quot;sorry to be mean but aren&#39;t you a little disappointed that he won?&quot; You looked at each other like for some reason ABSOLUTELY devastated. And then all u both did was go &quot;Pro-habar&quot; and gyrate your hips at the same time. You were teaching her to say your name.  </q></div> <div class="message"><abbr class="dt" title="2014-09-04T04:38:14.031Z">Sep 4, 2014, 4:38:14 AM

<q>That&#39;s incredible. I don&#39;t even know where to start in talking about that. I was saving that text for tonight to give me dream inspiration</q></div></div>
