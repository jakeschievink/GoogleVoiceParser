<q>Hey you little biddlyboops! So you know how we&#39;ve all expressed something along the lines of having friends for hampshire committees and the importance of peer feedback? Well, I&#39;m seriously in need right now and think you two are exactly the people who can give me some really cool and creative ideas. Professors are poop and I don&#39;t want to talk to them... Also, I really really really wanted a burger yesterday but local burger was closed when I got there and then it became like the WORST DAY OF MY LIFE!!!&#39; So anyway, I was just wondering if y&#39;all wanna get some burgers tomorrow for lunch or sometime this weekend and talk about all the awesome things we do or horrible crises in our lives? Lemme know âœ¨</q></div></div>
