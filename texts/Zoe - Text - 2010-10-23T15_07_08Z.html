<q>so afterwards, I took this jank car ride with burt and my giant red head friend to the party. I get there, take one massive hit, and it hit me so much. I didnt know I was so sensitive. but it was great. and Im still feeling it....its really mind blowing. anyway then I went on all these adventures and had conversation with people. Jesse was completely out of it and it was hilarious. It was real nice. </q></div> <div class="message"><abbr class="dt" title="2010-10-23T19:00:25.451Z">Oct 23, 2010, 7:00:25 PM

<q>oh and probably the stupidest but funniest thing I did that night. I wanted to do some mental experiments while I was like that, so I put myself in a room no one was in, closed the door, turned off all the lights, and tried to imagine the most horrible things that could happen until I was genuinely freaked out, and then I got myself out of it. Im proud of myself.</q></div> <div class="message"><abbr class="dt" title="2010-10-23T20:43:05.883Z">Oct 23, 2010, 8:43:05 PM
